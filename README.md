# shits

This is a [Ratatui] app inspired by [Google Sheets] and [Microsoft Excel].

The idea is to create a spreadsheet application that allows users to create, edit, and format spreadsheets in the terminal.

Im focusing on making it fast to navigate and use.
Just like sometimes you use a text editor to take notes instead of Notion, Obsidian.
Sometimes you need to calculate and take notes, but you don't want to use a text editor or a spreadsheet application.

Here's where shits come in, just type shits in the terminal and go.
You don't have to save it if you don't want to.
You don't need to wait for loading screens.
